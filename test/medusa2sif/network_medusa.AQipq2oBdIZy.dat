YTHDF1	0.903859154929577	0.386854190585534	c 117,179,239	990104: YTH domain family, member 1
HIVEP1	0.437380281690141	0.0871986222732491	c 117,117,239	991995: human immunodeficiency virus type I enhancer binding protein 1; This protein specifically binds to the DNA sequence 5'- GGGACTTTCC-3' which is found in the enhancer elements of numerous viral promoters such as those of SV40, CMV, or HIV-1. In addition, related sequences are found in the enhancer elements of a number of cellular promoters, including those of the class I MHC, interleukin-2 receptor, and interferon-beta genes. It may act in T-cell activation. Involved in activating HIV-1 gene expression. Isoform 2 and isoform 3 also bind to the IPCS (IRF1 and p53 common sequence) DNA sequ [...] 
APOO	0.270056338028169	0.0871986222732491	c 117,117,239	991965: apolipoprotein O; Promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophage cells. Detected in HDL, LDL and VLDL. Secreted by a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP)-dependent mechanism, probably as a VLDL-associated protein that is subsequently transferred to HDL. May be involved in myocardium-protective mechanisms against lipid accumulation
RANBP6	0.245211267605634	0.57284730195178	c 239,198,117	978488: RAN binding protein 6; May function in nuclear protein import as nuclear transport receptor
PSMA5	0.772028169014085	0.469001148105626	c 239,239,117	980092: proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, alpha type, 5; The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity (By similarity)
UBE2M	0.310619718309859	0.24735935706085	c 239,185,117	977929: ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2M pseudogene 1; Accepts the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 from the UBA3- NAE1 E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. The specific interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RBX1, but not RBX2, suggests that the RBX1-UBE2M complex neddylates specific target proteins, such as CUL1, CUL2, CUL3 and CUL4. Involved in cell proliferation
TAF11	0.316197183098592	0.522732491389208	c 117,211,239	989044: TAF11 RNA polymerase II, TATA box binding protein (TBP)-associated factor, 28kDa; Core TAFII present in both of the previously described TFIID species which either lack or contain TAFII30 (TFIID alpha and TFIID beta respectively)
